# 📌 Project Title

> ### **Monitoring System For Elderly Living Alone**



<br><br>
## 📖 Overview

This project aims to detect potential solitary deaths of elderly people living alone by analyzing remote metering data (water and electricity).  
We first experimented with an LSTM model, but later adopted a **GRU-based Autoencoder** for better performance.  
Also, The system includes a database (mariaDB) and web interface (Flask).

## 🧩 Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: 3 months of water and electric data from 1,000 households
- **Method**: Applied **Sliding Window** approach to segment time-series data for training
- No missing values found in the dataset
- No scaling or normalization applied

## 🤖 Model Training
- **Objective**: Focused on predicting **patterns/trends** rather than exact numeric values.
- **Approach**:
  - Trained an **AutoEncoder** on large volumes of data sequences generated by the `Sliding Window` method.
  - The model trains to reconstruct normal remote meter reading patterns.
- **Loss Function Improvement**:
  - Base loss: `MSELoss`
  - Added penalty when the **difference in consecutive values** is smaller than a set `threshold`  
    → Helps detect **nearly constant values** in usage patterns, which may indicate solitary death events.
  - `Threshold` is not fixed, as it depends on the distribution of the dataset.
